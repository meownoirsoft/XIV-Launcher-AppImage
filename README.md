# XIVLauncher for Linux (AppImage)

A portable AppImage build of [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) for Linux, designed to make launching **Final Fantasy XIV** easier without needing the official launcher.

This version was built and tested on **Linux Mint 22**, but it should run on any recent Linux distribution with basic dependencies.

---

## 🐧 What Is This?

This AppImage is a portable, standalone version of XIVLauncher for Linux users.

- ✅ No need to compile
- ✅ No root install
- ✅ Just download, `chmod +x`, and run!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Download the AppImage**

```bash
wget https://github.com/meownoirsoft/XIV-Launcher-AppImage/releases/latest/download/XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
```

### 2. Make it executable

```bash
chmod +x XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
```

### 3. Run it

```bash
./XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
```

First-time setup may take a few minutes as the launcher configures itself and downloads necessary files.

### ⚙️ Requirements
🎮 Steam version of FFXIV (optional but recommended)

✅ Vulkan drivers

✅ aria2 installed (for faster patching):

```bash
sudo apt install aria2
```

### 🧯 Troubleshooting
❗️"An error occurred trying to start process 'aria2c'"

Install aria2:

```bash
sudo apt install aria2
```

Or disable it in: Settings > Application > Use aria2 for patching.

❗️"DirectX 11 crashes or blank screen"

Make sure you’re using the latest Proton-GE via Steam or use Wine with DXVK and Vulkan support.

You can also launch with:

```bash
PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 ./XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
```

For testing graphics backend differences.

❗️"RPC service crashes" (or launcher doesn’t open)
Ensure libfuse2 is installed:

```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

Or try launching with --no-sandbox

❗️AppImage doesn't run
Try these:

```bash
chmod +x XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
./XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage
```
Or:

```bash
./XIVLauncher-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract
```
